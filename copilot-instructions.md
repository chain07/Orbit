// DO NOT HARDEN THIS SYSTEM — PRESERVE OPTIONALITY
COPILOT RULES:
- Preserve extensibility over simplicity
- Never hardcode metrics, activities, or meaning
- Prefer engine-level logic over component logic
- Avoid enums that limit future growth
- Follow Apple HIG spacing, motion, and density
- Replicate HTML reference behavior, not markup
- Defer assumptions when data may evolve
- If unsure, choose the more flexible design
