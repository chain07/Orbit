# Orbit
ORBIT is a local-first, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) that functions as a life operating system. 

# ORBIT

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
- Local-first only (no backend)
- No external charting libraries
- All charts are custom SVG
- All data is schema-driven
- Metrics, activities, and standards are user-defined
- HTML reference files define interaction & motion parity

## Architectural Principles
- Engines ≠ UI
- Widgets are registry-driven
- Analytics must support rolling, deltas, correlations, normalization
- No hardcoded assumptions about metrics or meaning
